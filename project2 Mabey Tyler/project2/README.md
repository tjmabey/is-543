#  Project 2

I added the Los Angeles Temple as this was the first Temple that I received my endowments in and ideally it is the Temple I would like to get married in.

My most special Temple moment came at the end of my mission service. The feelings in the celestial room were unforgettable and I recevied lots of guidance.

There was also one other time on my mission when many prayers were answered very directly to me. It is a special experience that I wont go into detail about.
